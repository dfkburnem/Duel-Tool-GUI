# Duel Tool GUI

This project provides a GUI for automating duels in DeFi Kingdoms. It allows users to configure duel settings which are saved for each duel type, enabling a user-friendly experience for repeated tasks. Additionally, the tool allows users to specify a duel limit for each session and can facilitate challenging the champion by optimizing queueing for the minimum win streak.

## Usage

1. **Select Duel Type**: Choose the type of duel you want to participate in (solo, squad, pack, warr).
2. **Select Stat and Background**: Select the primary stat and background for the duel.
3. **Specify Hero IDs**: Enter the IDs of the heroes you want to use in the duel.
4. **Select Entry Fee**: Choose the entry fee for the duel.
5. **Select Realm**: Choose the realm (Crystalvale or Serendale).
6. **Set Duel Limit**: Specify the number of duels to be performed.
7. **Enter Password**: Provide the password to decrypt your private key.
8. **Start the Duel**: Click the appropriate button to start the duel process.

## Important Notes

- **Config and ABI Files**: Ensure that the `duel_config.json` and `duel_abi.json` files are located in the same directory from which the script or executable is run.
- **Executable vs Script**: While the executable provides an easier way to run the application, it is not as trustless as running the script directly from the source code. If security and transparency are priorities, consider using the script.
